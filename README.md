# OBJ-Loader


This is a class for loading the data from a .obj file into an ecapsulated storage class, which will also function to fill an array or 'batch' with the loaded data, so that it can be sent through the OpenGL graphics pipeline.

I have seen bigger and better versions of the above, but I could get them to behave quite the way I wanted, so I just rolled my own. More for an exercise than anything else.

Included in this repository there is also a distinctly un-streamlined example the loader in action.

Feedback and comments are more than welcome!
